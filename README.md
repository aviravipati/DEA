# Data Engineering automation

ChatGPT can be used to create a data engineering automation solution that can streamline and optimize data processing tasks. The solution can be designed to automate various data-related tasks, including data extraction, data transformation, and data loading.

Through the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, ChatGPT can be trained to perform specific data processing tasks based on user input. This can help reduce the time and effort required for manual data processing, while also improving the accuracy and consistency of the results.

To implement this solution, you can start by identifying the specific data processing tasks that you want to automate. You can then create a training dataset that includes examples of input data and the corresponding output data. This dataset can be used to train the ChatGPT model to perform the desired data processing tasks.

Once the model has been trained, it can be integrated into your data engineering pipeline to automate the specified tasks. This can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your data processing workflows, while also reducing the risk of errors or inconsistencies.

Overall, using ChatGPT for data engineering automation can be a powerful tool for organizations looking to streamline their data processing workflows and optimize their data-related operations.

## Simple data engineering tasks

### Load Excel files into Database

To achieve this, we first need to ask user what kind of files that they want to load and whether the tables are already created, if so what are the table names and connection strings to read/write the database.

1. Ask user for list of files 
2. Location of the files (S3 or Local disk) 
3. Header on the file is used as record schema 
4. What kind of database that user wants to load into
5. if data from all the files > 10M ,we would like to provide some analytical database solution such as Redshift/Bigquery/Snowflake etc.
6. Execution engine for ETL (Glue/Spark etc) 
7. Setup infrastructure on cloud to perform such ETL
8. Provide insights to user and charts. 

At any step, user may change their mind and probably want to a different approach to the problem, our automated solution should be able to achieve that.

Get feedback from user along the process and ensure we arrive at the solution and executing scripts to provide end to end solution.
